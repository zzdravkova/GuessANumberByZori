"Guess A Number" is a simple guessing game where the player is supposed to guess the number that the oponent (the computer) has come up with. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. It will then ask the player to enter their guess. Each time the player enters a number, the computer will tell them whether it is lower or higher that the expected number.

The player wins the game when their number matches the computer's number.

## Input and Output
Choose **number** between 1 and 100, the press Enter.

The computer selects a **random number**, then returns information whether the number is **less than, greater than**, or **equal** to the selected **number**.
